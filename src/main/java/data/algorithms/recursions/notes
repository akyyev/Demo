Recursion
    - Calling the method inside the same method
    - Fibonacci, factorial and many more functions can be written easily

    Why?
        - Anything than can be done with recursion can be done iteratively (with loop)
        - Recursion is clever, readable and shortly but costly in terms of space complexity
        - When it comes to problems like sorting and tree traversal we can use recursive solutions to make things simple
          Particularly
            - Merge Sort
            - Quick Sort
            - Tree Traversal
            - Graph Traversal
